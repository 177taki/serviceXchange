# serviceXchange

An idea from the past:

Abstract ID space links any account in communication services, SNS services, or whatever, build graph topology of multiple abstract IDs and other accounts, deliver messages through that topology where control white list, black list, multicast, broadcast, anycast, alias and so on.
